# This is a very small modification from https://github.com/timrwwatson/ha-cups-sane-addon
Please don't use it as it's just for testing. I intend to expose sane scanner to other devices on the local network.

Otherwise there isn't anything new. I wasn't able to access the /data folders (due to running HA natively) thus forking and adding the repos at build time.
